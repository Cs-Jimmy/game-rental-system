# 🎮 Game Rental System (C# Windows Forms)

This project is a C# Windows Forms desktop application that simulates a basic Game Rental System. It demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations connected to a SQL Server database.

## 📋 Features
- View game rental data with JOIN queries across multiple related tables (Games, Vendors, Rentals, Clients, Users).
- Insert new records into:
  - Users & Clients
  - Vendors
  - Games
  - Rentals & related tables
- Update game and vendor details selectively.
- Delete game records along with related rental, retail, and supplies data safely (with confirmation prompts).
- Friendly Windows Forms interface using `DataGridView` and standard controls.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C# (.NET Framework)
- Windows Forms (WinForms)
- SQL Server (Local Database)
  
## Note
The actual database file is **not included**; this repository is intended to showcase my C# CRUD implementation and GUI design.
